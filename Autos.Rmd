## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.


Load libraries:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

library(modelr)

#install.packages("patchwork")

library(patchwork)


#install.packages("corrplot")

library(corrplot)

#install.packages("Hmisc")

library(Hmisc)
```


Loads cars data:

```{r}
cars70 <- read_csv("Automobile.csv")
```



Look a bit into the data:

```{r}
head(cars70)

str(cars70)

colnames(cars70)

summary(cars70)
```


Look at cars with HP greater than 200:

```{r}
filter(cars70, horsepower >= 200)
```


Lets visualize some data:

```{r}
ggplot(data = cars70, mapping = aes(x = horsepower, y = mpg))+
  geom_jitter((aes(color = mpg>30))) +
  facet_grid(origin~cylinders) +
  geom_smooth(se = F)


```



Which cars have more than 30 mpg?

```{r}
filter(cars70, mpg >30)

ggplot(cars70) +
  geom_histogram(aes(mpg))
```

No 8 cylinders get over 30 mpg. So, what is the max mpg?

```{r}
cars70$cylinders <- as.integer(cars70$cylinders)

(cars8cyl <- filter(cars70, cylinders == 8))

summary(cars8cyl$mpg)

ggplot(cars8cyl)+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(mpg, color = horsepower))

filter(cars70, mpg == 26.6)
```

What year models are in the data?

```{r}
unique(cars70$model_year)

```

OK, now lets look at the MGP per year: (Convert this to animation later)

```{r}
cars70$cylinders <- as.factor(cars70$cylinders)


ggplot(data = cars70, mapping = aes(x = model_year, y = mpg))+
  geom_jitter(mapping = aes(color = cylinders))+
  geom_smooth(aes(group = cylinders,color = cylinders), se = F)+
  xlab('Year')+
  ylab('MPG')+
  ggtitle("MPG Over Time")+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(color = "darkgreen"))
```


Messing with pipes to look at data for 4 cylinders:


```{r}
four_cyl <- cars70 %>%
  filter(cylinders == 4) %>%
  group_by(horsepower)%>%
  summarise(avg_mpg = mean(mpg))


ggplot(four_cyl, mapping = aes(x = horsepower, y = avg_mpg))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(se = F)+
  ggtitle("MPG vs Horsepower for 4cyl Cars")
```


Which cars have 6 cylinders or less but are heavier than 3000 pounds?

```{r}
cars70 %>% 
  mutate(cylinders = as.double(cylinders)) %>%
  filter(cylinders <= 6 & weight > 3000) %>%
  arrange(desc(weight))
  as.data.frame()
```

Modeling practice with cars. Is there a correlation between weight and mpg?

```{r}
no_lm <- ggplot(cars70, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = mpg)) +
  geom_point() +
  ggtitle("Car Weight vs. MPG")

car_weight <- lm(mpg ~ weight, data = cars70)
summary(car_weight)

grid  <- cars70 %>%
  data_grid(weight)

grid <- grid %>%
  add_predictions(car_weight)

 lm_cars <- ggplot(cars70, mapping = aes(x = weight, y = mpg))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_line(aes(y=pred), data = grid, color = "red", size = 1) +
  ggtitle("Car Weight vs. MPG w/ LR Model")

coef(car_weight)

cor(cars70$mpg, cars70$weight)

no_lm | lm_cars
```

Correlation plot of all the variables. The libraries needed for this are "Hmics" and "corrplot".

```{r}
num_cars70 <- cars70 %>%
  select(mpg : model_year) %>%
  mutate(cylinders = as.double(cylinders)) %>%
  as.data.frame()

num_cars70

num_cars70.cor = cor(num_cars70, use = "complete.obs") #to remove NA's use = "complete.obs

num_cars70.cor

num_cars70.rcorr = rcorr(as.matrix(num_cars70)) #correlation with P values

num_cars70.rcorr


corrplot(num_cars70.cor)


  
```

As acceleration increases, horsepower decreases? Added a liner model just for fun. Maybe weight has something to do with it. Let's color by weight.

```{r}
hpvacc <- lm(acceleration ~ horsepower, data = num_cars70)

hpvacc.grid <- num_cars70 %>%
  data_grid(horsepower) %>%
  add_predictions(hpvacc)



ggplot(num_cars70, mapping = aes(x = horsepower, y = acceleration, color = weight)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line(aes(y= pred), hpvacc.grid, color = "red")
  
```
